Android Studio新建Flutter项目时报错：
```
Error creating project
Could not find an option named "androidx". Run 'flutter -h' (or 'flutter   -h') for available flutter commands and options.
```

通过升级Flutter解决：
```
flutter upgrade
```

升级可能会出现错误：
```
Your flutter checkout has local changes that would be erased by upgrading. If you want to keep these changes, it is
recommended that you stash them via "git stash" or else commit the changes to a local branch. If it is okay to
remove local changes, then re-run this command with --force.
```

添加 --force 重新运行命令：
```
flutter upgrade --force
```
