Flutter运行时出现错误：
```
[!] Gradle does not have execution permission.
    You should change the ownership of the project directory to your user, or move the project to a directory with execute permissions.
```

通过命令行 ls -l 查看 gradlew （ProjectRootPath/android/gradlew）权限：
```
-rw-r--r--  1 autoref  staff  4971 Jan  2 16:51 gradlew
```

可以看出 gradlew 没有执行权限，通过命令添加执行权限解决：
```
chmod a+x gradlew
```
